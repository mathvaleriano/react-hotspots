`What's a Hotspot? It's a visual effect to show something new.`

### Motivation

This project has been created based on a [challenge](https://github.com/Conpass/challenges/blob/master/Frontend-Challenge.md) proposed by the [Conpass](https://www.conpass.io/) Team but I liked so much of the idea that has been proposed and hooks was comming. So I decided to implement a project to show some useful hooks and react createPortal (it's awesome too).

This project has some **forced clicks** (it's not a bug) if you put some hotspot on links in navbar... it'll redirect you to some page like my linkedin (**hire me**, lol), github (this repo) or my twitter account.

### How it works

1. Add a hotspot clicking on button (**create hotspot**)
2. Click on some element of the screen to place hotspot
3. Add some title and text
4. Save it
5. You can hide the poppup clicking on the hotspot
6. You can delete hotspots with **Delete** button located at hotspots list

### Setup
